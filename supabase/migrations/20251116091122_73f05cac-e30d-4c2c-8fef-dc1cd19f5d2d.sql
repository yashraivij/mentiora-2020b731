'Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. This remarkable transformation occurs in chloroplasts, specialized structures within plant cells. [The process involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions.] During light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs light energy to split water molecules. The light-independent reactions, also called the Calvin cycle, use that energy to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.',

'The Mediterranean diet, characterized by high consumption of olive oil, vegetables, fruits, and fish, has been associated with numerous health benefits. Studies spanning decades show that people following this dietary pattern have lower rates of heart disease and longer life expectancies compared to those consuming typical Western diets. The diet emphasizes unsaturated fats from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from fish. As chronic diseases rise globally, many nutritionists recommend this traditional eating pattern as a sustainable approach to preventive health.',
'{"A": "describe the components and health benefits of the Mediterranean diet", "B": "argue that the Mediterranean diet should replace all other dietary approaches", "C": "explain why olive oil is superior to other cooking fats", "D": "compare Mediterranean and Western diets in terms of taste and cost"}',
'A',
'{"rationale": "The passage systematically presents what the Mediterranean diet includes (olive oil, vegetables, fish) and what benefits it provides (lower heart disease, longer life). This descriptive approach is the passage''s clear purpose.", "why_others_wrong": {"B": "Too strong; passage recommends but does not demand replacement", "C": "Olive oil is mentioned but is not the focus", "D": "No discussion of taste or cost appears"}}',

'The main rhetorical effect of the second paragraph is to',
'Marie Curies contributions to science revolutionized our understanding of radioactivity. Born in Warsaw in 1867, she overcame significant barriers facing women in science to become the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences—physics and chemistry. Her discovery of radium and polonium opened new fields of research, but the work came at enormous personal cost. Curie conducted her experiments without understanding radiations dangers, often carrying test tubes of radioactive material in her pockets. This exposure ultimately led to her death from aplastic anemia in 1934, a disease caused by radiation damage. Despite these sacrifices, Curies legacy extends beyond her discoveries. She established precedents for women in science and demonstrated that dedication to knowledge sometimes requires accepting great personal risks.',
'{"A": "emphasize the dangerous conditions that made Curies research possible", "B": "provide a cautionary example that undercuts the heroic portrayal in the first paragraph", "C": "complicate the narrative by revealing the personal costs of Curies achievements", "D": "shift focus from scientific discovery to biographical tragedy"}',
'C',
'{"rationale": "The second paragraph adds complexity by showing that alongside revolutionary discoveries came severe personal consequences (radiation exposure, eventual death). It complicates rather than undercuts the first paragraphs achievements—both remain true simultaneously.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Focus is on personal cost to Curie, not general research conditions", "B": "Does not undercut; the achievements remain valid despite costs", "D": "Too extreme; maintains focus on the relationship between achievement and sacrifice"}}',

'The author mentions computer simulations primarily to',
'For decades, scientists debated whether the extinction of dinosaurs resulted from a single catastrophic event or gradual environmental changes. The discovery of a massive impact crater in Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula provided physical evidence for the asteroid impact theory. Computer simulations of such an impact predict global firestorms, tsunamis, and years of darkened skies—conditions that would devastate ecosystems worldwide. These predictions align remarkably well with geological evidence: a global layer of iridium (rare on Earth but common in asteroids) dating to 66 million years ago, shocked quartz indicating massive pressure waves, and fossilized soot suggesting vast wildfires. The convergence of simulation predictions with physical evidence strongly supports the impact hypothesis.',
'{"A": "demonstrate that technology has resolved previously unsolvable scientific questions", "B": "show how predictions from the impact hypothesis match observed geological evidence", "C": "prove that asteroid impacts have occurred multiple times in Earths history", "D": "explain why earlier scientists failed to discover the extinction cause"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The simulations serve to generate testable predictions (firestorms, tsunamis, darkened skies) which are then compared to actual evidence (iridium layer, shocked quartz, soot). This matching of prediction to observation supports the hypothesis—that is the simulations function in the argument.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Too broad; passage is about this specific question, not technologys general role", "C": "Passage discusses one extinction event, not multiple impacts", "D": "Earlier scientists are not discussed"}}',

'Which choice best describes the function of the final sentence in the passage?',
'Urban farming initiatives have gained popularity as cities seek to address food security and sustainability challenges. Community gardens and rooftop farms now produce fresh vegetables in neighborhoods previously classified as food deserts—areas lacking access to affordable, nutritious food. These projects provide local employment, reduce transportation emissions, and strengthen community bonds through shared cultivation efforts. However, urban agriculture faces significant constraints. Limited space, soil contamination from industrial history, high real estate costs, and zoning restrictions prevent scaling operations to meet substantial portions of urban food demand. [While urban farms offer valuable community benefits, their capacity to significantly reduce cities dependence on external food sources remains limited.]',
'{"A": "It synthesizes the competing claims about urban farming by acknowledging both contributions and limitations.", "B": "It dismisses urban farming as an ineffective solution to food security issues.", "C": "It calls for policy changes to address the challenges identified in the previous sentence.", "D": "It introduces a new argument about community benefits that was not previously mentioned."}',
'A',
'{"rationale": "The final sentence balances both sides presented in the passage: it affirms the community benefits discussed earlier (valuable community benefits) while acknowledging the limitations described in the constraints section (capacity remains limited). This synthesis is typical of concluding sentences.", "why_others_wrong": {"B": "Does not dismiss; explicitly states farms offer valuable benefits", "C": "No policy recommendations appear", "D": "Community benefits were already discussed; this sentence references them"}}',

'The primary purpose of the discussion of linguistic relativity in the passage is to',
'Human language shapes thought in complex ways that linguists continue to investigate. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, also known as linguistic relativity, proposes that the structure of a language affects its speakers worldview and cognition. In its strong form, this hypothesis suggests language determines thought—that concepts cannot be understood without words to express them. However, most contemporary linguists reject this deterministic view. Instead, research supports a weaker version: language influences but does not strictly determine thinking. For example, studies show that speakers of languages with many basic color terms perceive and remember colors slightly differently than speakers of languages with fewer color words. Yet people can learn new color distinctions, indicating language facilitates but does not limit conceptual abilities. This more nuanced understanding reveals language as one of many factors shaping cognition, rather than an absolute constraint on human thought.',
'{"A": "introduce a hypothesis that will be completely refuted by subsequent evidence", "B": "present competing versions of a theory to establish which interpretation research supports", "C": "explain why strong linguistic determinism remains the dominant view in modern linguistics", "D": "provide historical context before transitioning to an unrelated topic"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage introduces the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, explicitly notes it has strong and weak forms, explains that the strong form is rejected while the weak form is supported, and provides evidence for the weak version. This is textbook presentation of competing interpretations with resolution.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Not completely refuted; the weak version is supported", "C": "Passage explicitly states strong determinism is rejected, not dominant", "D": "The subsequent discussion directly relates to linguistic relativity"}}',

'The main rhetorical effect of the authors use of specific monetary figures in the second paragraph is to',
'Economic inequality in the United States has reached levels unprecedented in modern history. This growing wealth gap affects not just individual financial security but the fundamental structure of democratic participation and social mobility. Consider the concrete reality: in 1978, the ratio of CEO compensation to typical worker pay was 30 to 1. By 2020, that ratio had expanded to 351 to 1. The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans now hold more wealth than the entire middle class. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, has decreased by 18 percent since its peak purchasing power in 1968. These are not abstract statistics—they represent the lived experiences of millions working full-time jobs while unable to afford housing, healthcare, or education. The consequences extend beyond individual hardship. When economic power concentrates in so few hands, political influence follows. Wealthy donors fund campaigns, hire lobbyists, and shape policy in ways that protect their interests, creating a feedback loop that perpetuates inequality.',
'{"A": "establish the authors expertise in economic policy analysis", "B": "transform abstract claims about inequality into quantifiable, verifiable evidence", "C": "demonstrate that wealth inequality is inevitable in market economies", "D": "compare current American inequality to historical examples from other nations"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage moves from a general claim about unprecedented inequality to specific numbers (30 to 1 vs. 351 to 1 ratios, top 1 percent wealth, 18 percent decrease in minimum wage). These figures make the abstract concept concrete and provable, which is the rhetorical function of using specific data. The passage even explicitly states these are not abstract statistics.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "No credentials or expertise claims appear", "C": "Passage argues inequality is problematic, not inevitable", "D": "No international or historical comparisons are made"}}',

'The passages discussion of mirror neurons primarily serves to',
'Empathy—the ability to understand and share others emotional experiences—has long been considered a uniquely human capacity. However, research over the past two decades has challenged this anthropocentric view. The discovery of mirror neurons in macaque monkeys provided a neurological basis for understanding how primates might experience others states. These specialized brain cells fire both when an individual performs an action and when they observe another performing the same action. Some neuroscientists initially speculated that mirror neurons might be the neurological foundation of empathy, a mechanism allowing individuals to simulate others experiences in their own minds. Yet this neural mechanism alone does not explain empathy complexity. Observing someones action is quite different from feeling their emotional state. Subsequent research has revealed that empathy likely involves multiple interconnected neural systems—mirror neurons may contribute to understanding actions, but emotional empathy appears to engage additional brain regions involved in emotional processing and regulation. Furthermore, studies of other species reveal empathy-like behaviors in animals without mirror neurons, suggesting this particular neural mechanism is not necessary for empathetic responses. The picture that emerges is more complex than early mirror neuron enthusiasts proposed: empathy results from interactions among multiple systems rather than a single neural pathway.',
'{"A": "establish a complete neurological explanation for how empathy functions across species", "B": "introduce a potential mechanism that is later revealed to be insufficient as a complete explanation", "C": "provide definitive evidence that empathy is uniquely human despite appearances in other species", "D": "demonstrate that earlier theories of empathy were entirely incorrect and should be discarded"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage presents mirror neurons as an initial promising explanation (neurological basis, foundation of empathy), then systematically shows this explanation is incomplete: action understanding is not equal to emotional empathy, other systems involved, empathy exists without mirror neurons. The discussion serves to set up and then complicate a too-simple explanation.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Passage explicitly argues against complete explanation", "C": "Passage challenges human uniqueness, does not support it", "D": "Mirror neurons are not dismissed entirely; they just do not fully explain empathy alone"}}',

'The main purpose of the passage is to',
'Permafrost, permanently frozen ground covering approximately 24 percent of Northern Hemisphere land, is rapidly thawing due to climate warming. This thaw poses significant environmental concerns. Permafrost contains massive amounts of organic matter from dead plants and animals that accumulated over millennia. As temperatures rise and ice melts, microorganisms decompose this organic material, releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases contribute to further warming, creating a feedback loop that accelerates climate change.',
'{"A": "explain a climate-related phenomenon and its consequences", "B": "argue for immediate policy interventions to stop permafrost thaw", "C": "describe the geological history of permafrost formation", "D": "compare permafrost thaw to other environmental challenges"}',

This is explanatory in nature.", "why_others_wrong": {"B": "No policy recommendations appear", "C": "History of formation is not discussed; focus is on current thawing", "D": "No comparisons to other environmental issues are made"}}',

'The author mentions successful species introductions primarily in order to',
'Invasive species—organisms introduced to ecosystems where they did not naturally occur—rank among the most serious threats to biodiversity worldwide. When removed from their native predators and diseases, invasives often reproduce unchecked, outcompeting native species for resources. The brown tree snakes introduction to Guam eliminated most of the islands native bird species. Zebra mussels clog water infrastructure and disrupt aquatic ecosystems throughout North America. While some successful species introductions have occurred without causing harm—honeybees in North America and various agricultural crops globally—these exceptions do not diminish the overall pattern. The vast majority of deliberate and accidental introductions create ecological and economic damage, justifying precautionary approaches to preventing species movements across natural barriers.',
'{"A": "acknowledge a counterargument while maintaining the passages primary claim", "B": "prove that species introductions can be beneficial if properly managed", "C": "undermine the claim that invasive species threaten biodiversity", "D": "shift the focus from environmental concerns to economic considerations"}',
'A',
'{"rationale": "The author presents examples that seem to contradict the anti-invasive stance (honeybees, crops), acknowledges them as exceptions, then explicitly states they do not diminish the overall pattern. This is classic counterargument acknowledgment that strengthens rather than weakens the main argument.", "why_others_wrong": {"B": "Passage does not advocate for managing introductions; it supports prevention", "C": "Explicitly states exceptions do not change the threat pattern", "D": "Economic damage is mentioned but is not the focus of this reference"}}',

'Which choice best describes the relationship between the two paragraphs in the passage?',
'Genetic engineering of crops has enabled farmers to increase yields dramatically. Bt corn, modified to produce a natural pesticide, reduces the need for chemical insecticides while protecting harvests from destructive insects. Drought-resistant varieties help farmers maintain production despite climate uncertainty. Golden Rice, enriched with vitamin A, has potential to address nutritional deficiencies affecting millions in developing nations. Proponents argue these technologies represent humanity best chance to feed a growing global population sustainably. Yet critics raise substantial concerns about genetic modifications long-term consequences. Modified genes can spread to wild relatives through cross-pollination, potentially creating superweeds resistant to herbicides. Corporate control of patented seeds reduces farmers autonomy and concentrates agricultural power. The technologys focus on industrial monoculture may undermine biodiversity and traditional farming knowledge. Moreover, the promised benefits often fail to materialize: Golden Rice remains unavailable to most who need it decades after development, while expensive modified seeds provide limited advantage to small-scale farmers who lack access to the irrigation and inputs these varieties require.',

'B',
'{"rationale": "Paragraph 1 presents claimed benefits (increased yields, reduced pesticides, addressing malnutrition). Paragraph 2 does not fully reject these but adds critical context: unintended consequences (superweeds), systemic issues (corporate control), and importantly, examples where benefits failed to materialize (Golden Rice unavailable, limited help for small farmers). This pattern matches benefits contextualized with limitations.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "No hypothesis testing; these are claims and counterclaims, not experimental design", "C": "Not historical versus recent; both discuss current technology", "D": "Neither paragraph discusses regulation"}}',

'The primary function of the quoted dialogue in the passage is to',
'Frederick Douglass 1852 speech What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July remains one of American historys most powerful critiques of hypocrisy. Delivered to an abolitionist audience in Rochester, New York, Douglass confronted his listeners with uncomfortable truths about celebrating freedom in a nation that enslaved millions. Rather than offering comfortable praise for American ideals, he challenged his audience directly: What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? These rhetorical questions forced listeners to confront the contradiction between American principles and American practice. Douglass was not seeking to condemn the Fourth of Julys ideals—he affirmed those principles while exposing how far the nation fell short of them. By speaking from the perspective of the enslaved, using your independence rather than our independence, he made clear the exclusion at the heart of American freedom. This strategic positioning gave his critique undeniable moral force.',
