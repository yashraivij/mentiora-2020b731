'Which choice provides the best evidence for the claim that early agricultural societies developed complex social hierarchies?',
'Archaeological evidence from Mesopotamia reveals that early agricultural settlements around 6000 BCE began to show marked differences in dwelling sizes and burial practices. While most homes remained small and uniform, certain structures featured multiple rooms, storage areas, and decorative elements. Similarly, grave sites from this period show variation in burial goods, with some individuals interred with pottery, tools, and ornamental items, while others had simple burials with no accompanying objects.',

'Which quotation from the passage best supports the idea that phytoplankton are essential to ocean ecosystems?',
'Phytoplankton, microscopic plants that drift in ocean waters, form the foundation of marine food webs. These tiny organisms produce approximately 50 percent of the oxygen in Earths atmosphere through photosynthesis. Marine animals from zooplankton to massive whales depend on phytoplankton either directly or indirectly for sustenance. When phytoplankton populations decline due to warming waters or reduced nutrients, the effects cascade through entire oceanic food chains, often leading to reduced fish populations and disrupted migration patterns.',

'The author claims that urban green spaces provide mental health benefits. Which finding, if true, would most directly support this claim?',
'Urban planners increasingly recognize that green spaces—parks, gardens, and tree-lined streets—offer more than aesthetic value to cities. Recent studies suggest these areas may provide significant mental health benefits to residents. However, the mechanisms through which nature exposure affects psychological well-being remain under investigation. Some researchers propose that green spaces reduce stress by providing respite from urban stimuli, while others suggest that the physical activity encouraged by parks drives the mental health improvements.',

'Which choice best supports the authors assertion that the printing press democratized knowledge in Europe?',
'Johann Gutenbergs invention of the printing press in 1440 fundamentally transformed European society. Before this innovation, books were copied by hand, making them expensive and accessible primarily to wealthy individuals and religious institutions. A single Bible might take a scribe over a year to produce. After Gutenbergs press, books could be produced in days rather than months, reducing costs dramatically. By 1500, an estimated 20 million volumes had been printed across Europe. Literacy rates began to rise as books became affordable to merchants, craftspeople, and eventually common laborers.',

'Which statement from the passage provides the strongest evidence that coral bleaching is increasing in frequency?',
'Coral bleaching occurs when stressed corals expel their symbiotic algae, turning white and often dying if conditions dont improve quickly. Historically, mass bleaching events were rare, with major occurrences documented in 1983, 1998, and 2002. However, the pattern has changed dramatically in recent years. Between 2014 and 2017, the Great Barrier Reef experienced three separate mass bleaching events—an unprecedented frequency. Scientists attribute this acceleration to rising ocean temperatures caused by climate change. Water temperatures just 1 to 2 degrees Celsius above normal summer maximums can trigger bleaching.',

'The researchers argue that sleep deprivation impairs decision-making. Which experimental result would provide the strongest support for this claim?',
'Sleep deprivations effects on cognitive function have been extensively studied, yet the specific mechanisms affecting decision-making remain debated. While some research suggests that fatigue simply slows processing speed, others propose that sleep loss fundamentally alters how the brain evaluates risks and rewards. Neuroimaging studies show reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex—the region responsible for executive functions—in sleep-deprived individuals. Additionally, studies of professional workers making critical decisions after insufficient sleep show concerning patterns, though isolating sleep as the causal factor proves challenging given multiple workplace variables.',
'{"A": "Brain scans showing that sleep-deprived participants had 40 percent less prefrontal cortex activity when evaluating complex scenarios compared to well-rested controls.", "B": "A study finding that participants who slept fewer than 5 hours chose immediate small rewards over delayed larger rewards 65 percent more often than those who slept 8 hours.", "C": "Survey data indicating that 83 percent of professionals report feeling their judgment is impaired after poor sleep.", "D": "Research demonstrating that sleep-deprived participants completed decision-making tasks 22 percent slower than rested participants."}',

'Which piece of evidence would most strengthen the authors claim that ancient Polynesians possessed sophisticated navigation knowledge?',
'Polynesian voyagers settled islands across the vast Pacific Ocean without modern instruments, a feat that has led anthropologists to study their navigation methods. These seafarers read wave patterns, identified consistent stellar paths, and recognized subtle changes in bird behavior to locate land beyond the horizon. Some scholars initially attributed Polynesian settlement patterns to accidental drift voyages. However, computer simulations of drift patterns fail to match actual settlement chronology. Moreover, Polynesian oral traditions contain detailed navigational knowledge passed through generations, describing specific star courses and ocean current behaviors.',
'{"A": "Archaeological evidence showing that settlement of distant islands occurred in a consistent west-to-east pattern matching prevailing winds.", "B": "Computer models demonstrating that intentional navigation following described Polynesian techniques can replicate the actual settlement pattern and timing.", "C": "Linguistic analysis revealing that navigation terms in Polynesian languages show remarkable consistency across thousands of miles.", "D": "Historical accounts from European explorers describing their surprise at Polynesian boats ocean-going capabilities."}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "Choice B provides the strongest evidence by showing that using Polynesian navigation knowledge produces the observed outcome. This demonstrates the techniques worked and werent accidental.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Pattern could still result from drift with favorable winds", "C": "Shared vocabulary doesn''t prove the knowledge was sophisticated enough for ocean crossings", "D": "Shows capability of vessels but not navigation knowledge"}}',

'Which finding would best support the hypothesis that wolves reintroduction caused the observed ecological changes in Yellowstone?',
'When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 after a 70-year absence, ecologists observed numerous environmental changes. Elk populations declined and shifted their grazing patterns, avoiding vulnerable river valleys. Riverbank vegetation that had been overgrazed for decades began recovering. Willow and aspen trees grew taller, their increased canopy cover cooling stream waters. Beaver populations expanded as more trees became available for dam construction. Some scientists propose that wolves presence triggered this trophic cascade, while others suggest that concurrent changes in precipitation patterns or other factors may have contributed to or caused these ecosystem shifts.',
'{"A": "Data showing that elk populations declined by 50 percent in areas where wolves were most active, while remaining stable in wolf-free regions of the greater Yellowstone ecosystem.", "B": "Evidence that vegetation recovery began in 1996, within one year of wolf reintroduction.", "C": "Observations that wolves preferentially hunt elk in riparian areas, reducing grazing pressure in these sensitive zones.", "D": "Historical records indicating that similar vegetation patterns existed before wolf extermination in the 1920s."}',
'A',
'{"rationale": "Choice A provides the strongest causal evidence through spatial comparison: areas with wolves showed elk decline, while areas without wolves showed stable populations. This isolates wolves as the causal factor and rules out park-wide variables.", "why_others_wrong": {"B": "Temporal correlation but doesn''t rule out coincident factors", "C": "Explains mechanism but doesn''t prove wolves caused broader changes", "D": "Historical parallel doesn''t prove causation in current case"}}',

'Which sentence best supports the claim that smartphones have changed social interaction patterns?',
'Smartphones have become ubiquitous in developed nations, with over 85 percent of adults now owning these devices. The technology offers unprecedented connectivity, allowing instant communication across vast distances. However, psychologists have noted concerning trends in face-to-face interactions. Studies show that the mere presence of a smartphone on a table during conversation reduces the quality of interaction and participants reported feelings of connection. Young adults now spend an average of 4 hours daily on their phones, time that was historically devoted to in-person socializing.',

'The passage argues that microplastics pose environmental risks. Which statement provides the strongest evidence for this argument?',
'Microplastics—plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters—have been detected in environments worldwide, from Arctic ice to ocean depths. These particles originate from larger plastic items breaking down and from products like cosmetics containing plastic microbeads. Scientists have found microplastics in the digestive systems of marine animals, from plankton to fish consumed by humans. Laboratory studies demonstrate that plastic particles can absorb and concentrate toxins from surrounding water. While microplastics long-term effects on ecosystems remain under study, their persistence and bioaccumulation patterns raise concerns among environmental scientists.',

'Which research result would most directly challenge the hypothesis that exercise improves memory through increased brain oxygen?',
'Exercise has been consistently linked to improved memory and cognitive function, but the physiological mechanisms remain debated. The prevailing hypothesis suggests that physical activity increases blood flow to the brain, delivering more oxygen and nutrients to neurons. Supporting this view, imaging studies show elevated blood flow in memory-related brain regions following exercise. However, some researchers propose alternative explanations, suggesting that exercise-induced hormone release or stress reduction may drive cognitive benefits. Isolating the specific causal pathway has proven challenging because exercise affects multiple physiological systems simultaneously.',
'{"A": "A study finding that memory improvements occur even when participants exercise in low-oxygen environments where brain oxygenation doesnt increase.", "B": "Research showing that brain blood flow remains elevated for 2 hours after exercise while memory benefits last for days.", "C": "Evidence that sedentary individuals have lower memory scores than regular exercisers across multiple age groups.", "D": "Data demonstrating that different forms of exercise produce similar memory improvements despite different cardiovascular effects."}',

'Which piece of evidence would best support the claim that early hominids used fire for cooking before developing language?',
'The timeline of human technological development remains debated, particularly regarding the relative emergence of controlled fire use and language. Archaeological evidence shows clear signs of controlled fire at sites dating to 800,000 years ago, with some contested evidence suggesting use as early as 1.5 million years ago. Chemical analysis of ancient hominin teeth reveals significant changes in enamel structure around 1.9 million years ago, consistent with consumption of cooked food. Meanwhile, anatomical features necessary for complex speech—specific throat and vocal cord structures—appear in the fossil record around 500,000 years ago, though behavioral evidence of symbolic thought suggesting language capability may date earlier.',
