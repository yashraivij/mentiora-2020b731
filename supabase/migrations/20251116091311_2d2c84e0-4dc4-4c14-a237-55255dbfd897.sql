'Based on the passage, which statement about renewable energy costs is most accurate?',
'Ten years ago, renewable energy sources like solar and wind were significantly more expensive than fossil fuels, making widespread adoption economically challenging. However, rapid technological advances and economies of scale have dramatically reduced costs. Solar panel prices have fallen by over 80 percent since 2010. Wind turbine efficiency has improved substantially through better blade design and taller towers that capture stronger winds. Today, in many regions, new renewable energy installations cost less than building new coal or natural gas plants. These price trends continue to improve, suggesting renewables will become even more economically attractive in the coming years.',
'{"A": "Renewable energy will always cost more than fossil fuels.", "B": "Technological improvements have made renewable energy increasingly cost-competitive.", "C": "Solar energy is now free to produce in most regions.", "D": "Wind energy costs have remained constant over the past decade."}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage describes how technological advances and economies of scale have dramatically reduced costs, solar prices fell 80 percent, and renewables now often cost less than new fossil fuel plants. This directly supports that technological improvements made renewables cost-competitive.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Contradicts passage stating renewables now often cost less", "C": "Solar is less expensive, not free", "D": "Passage explicitly states wind efficiency has improved"}}',

'The passage most strongly suggests that the researchers findings about meditation were',
'Researchers conducted a study examining meditation effects on workplace stress. Participants who practiced 10 minutes of guided meditation daily for eight weeks reported significantly lower stress levels compared to a control group. Brain scans revealed increased activity in regions associated with emotional regulation. Participants also demonstrated improved focus on complex tasks and reported better sleep quality. While the study size was modest and lasted only two months, the results encouraged researchers to pursue longer-term investigations with larger participant pools.',
'{"A": "conclusive proof that meditation eliminates workplace stress", "B": "promising but require further study to confirm", "C": "contradictory to previous research on meditation", "D": "applicable only to people with sleep disorders"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage presents positive results (lower stress, better focus, improved sleep) but explicitly states the study was modest in size and duration, and researchers want to pursue further investigation. This indicates promise requiring additional confirmation.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Passage emphasizes limited scope and need for more research", "C": "No mention of contradicting previous research", "D": "Study involved general workplace stress, not specifically sleep disorders"}}',

'The authors use of the phrase tipping point most nearly suggests that climate scientists believe',
'Climate scientists warn that global temperature increases beyond 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels represent a critical tipping point. Beyond this threshold, feedback mechanisms may amplify warming in ways that become increasingly difficult to reverse. Arctic ice reflects sunlight back into space, but as it melts, darker ocean water absorbs more heat, accelerating further melting. Similarly, thawing permafrost releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that drives additional warming. These self-reinforcing cycles could push Earth into climate states dramatically different from current conditions, even if emissions are subsequently reduced.',
'{"A": "gradual changes will continue at a steady pace regardless of temperature increases", "B": "certain temperature thresholds could trigger accelerating and difficult-to-reverse changes", "C": "climate change will suddenly stop once specific temperatures are reached", "D": "all warming effects can be easily reversed with emission reductions"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage describes a tipping point as a threshold beyond which feedback mechanisms amplify warming in difficult-to-reverse ways, and self-reinforcing cycles push Earth into dramatically different states. This matches triggering accelerating, hard-to-reverse changes.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Passage describes acceleration, not steady pace", "C": "Changes accelerate beyond the point, not stop", "D": "Passage explicitly states changes become difficult to reverse"}}',

'It can most reasonably be inferred from the passage that the authors attitude toward artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis is',
'Artificial intelligence systems now match or exceed human doctors accuracy in diagnosing certain conditions from medical imaging. AI can identify subtle patterns in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans that human eyes might miss. However, successful medical diagnosis requires more than pattern recognition. Doctors must consider patient history, understand complex symptom interactions, and communicate diagnoses with empathy and clarity. AI systems excel at specific, well-defined tasks but lack the broader clinical judgment and human connection essential to patient care. The most promising approach combines AI analytical capabilities with physicians medical expertise and interpersonal skills.',
'{"A": "enthusiastically supportive of replacing doctors with AI systems", "B": "cautiously optimistic about AI as a tool to assist rather than replace doctors", "C": "completely skeptical of any value AI provides in medical settings", "D": "concerned that AI will reduce the need for medical school training"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The author acknowledges AI strengths (matching doctor accuracy, identifying subtle patterns) but emphasizes limitations (lacks clinical judgment, human connection). The conclusion advocates combining AI capabilities with physician expertise—this is cautiously optimistic about AI as an assistive tool.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Author explicitly argues against replacement, favoring combination", "C": "Author acknowledges AI provides value in pattern recognition", "D": "Author emphasizes continued need for physician expertise and skills"}}',

'Based on the passage, the author would most likely agree with which statement about historical preservation?',
'Cities facing rapid development must balance economic growth with historical preservation. Demolishing historic buildings may enable profitable construction, but it erases irreplaceable cultural heritage and community identity. Conversely, overly rigid preservation policies can stifle necessary modernization and make housing unaffordable. Several cities have found middle ground through adaptive reuse—converting historic structures for contemporary purposes while maintaining architectural character. Old factories become art galleries, historic warehouses transform into apartments, and vintage theaters host modern performances. This approach honors the past while serving present needs.',
'{"A": "All historic buildings should be preserved regardless of economic considerations.", "B": "Historical preservation should never interfere with new construction projects.", "C": "Successful preservation can accommodate both heritage conservation and contemporary needs.", "D": "Adaptive reuse is the only acceptable approach to urban development."}',
'C',
'{"rationale": "The passage advocates for balancing preservation with development, criticizes both extreme demolition and overly rigid preservation, and praises adaptive reuse for honoring the past while serving present needs. This supports accommodating both heritage and contemporary needs.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Author criticizes overly rigid preservation as problematic", "B": "Author values preservation, not unrestricted development", "D": "Adaptive reuse is praised as one successful approach, not presented as the only option"}}',

'Which conclusion about bee colony collapse is most strongly supported by the passage?',
'Since 2006, beekeepers worldwide have reported unprecedented colony collapse, with worker bees mysteriously abandoning hives. Multiple factors appear to contribute to this phenomenon. Neonicotinoid pesticides impair bee navigation and immune systems. Varroa mites spread viruses that weaken colonies. Monoculture agriculture reduces available nutrition by eliminating wildflower diversity. Climate change disrupts flowering schedules that bees depend on for food. Researchers increasingly believe that no single cause drives colony collapse. Instead, these stressors interact synergistically—combined effects exceed what each factor would cause individually. A colony weakened by poor nutrition becomes more susceptible to pesticide harm, while pesticide-damaged bees struggle more with mite infestations.',
'{"A": "Eliminating neonicotinoid pesticides would completely solve bee colony collapse.", "B": "Colony collapse results from multiple interacting factors rather than a single cause.", "C": "Varroa mites are the primary and most important cause of colony decline.", "D": "Climate change affects bees but plays no significant role in colony collapse."}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage explicitly states researchers believe no single cause drives colony collapse, describes multiple contributing factors, and emphasizes that stressors interact synergistically with combined effects exceeding individual factors. This directly supports multiple interacting factors.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Passage describes multiple causes working together, not one solution", "C": "Mites are one factor among many, not identified as primary", "D": "Climate change is explicitly listed as a contributing factor"}}',

'The passage most strongly suggests that the development of writing systems',
'The invention of writing systems marked a fundamental transition in human civilization. Early writing emerged independently in several regions—Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mesoamerica—each developing distinct symbol systems suited to their languages. Initially, writing served primarily administrative functions: recording harvests, tracking trade transactions, and documenting tax obligations. However, once established, writing enabled revolutionary new possibilities. Knowledge could be preserved across generations without relying on memory. Legal codes could be standardized and consulted. Literature and philosophy became possible, allowing complex ideas to be refined and debated over time. The invention of writing did not merely record existing practices—it transformed what humans could think and organize.',
'{"A": "happened simultaneously across all ancient civilizations through cultural diffusion", "B": "remained limited to administrative uses throughout ancient history", "C": "enabled new forms of knowledge preservation and intellectual activity beyond its initial purposes", "D": "was primarily invented for creating literature and philosophical texts"}',
'C',
'{"rationale": "The passage states writing initially served administrative functions but once established enabled revolutionary new possibilities including knowledge preservation, legal standardization, and literature/philosophy. This shows it enabled new activities beyond initial purposes.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Passage states writing emerged independently, not through diffusion", "B": "Passage describes writing expanding far beyond administration", "D": "Administration came first; literature developed later as a consequence"}}',

'Based on the passage, which statement about antibiotic resistance most accurately reflects the researchers position?',
'Antibiotic resistance poses one of modern medicines gravest challenges. When antibiotics are overused or misused, bacteria evolve resistance mechanisms, rendering these drugs ineffective. The problem extends beyond human medicine—agricultural operations routinely administer antibiotics to livestock, not to treat illness but to promote faster growth. This practice creates ideal conditions for resistance to develop and spread. Resistant bacteria from farms can transfer resistance genes to human pathogens through multiple pathways: direct contact with animals, consumption of contaminated meat, or environmental spread through water and soil. Some researchers advocate banning non-therapeutic antibiotic use in agriculture entirely, while others propose restricting only those antibiotics critical for human medicine. What remains undisputed is that current practices are unsustainable.',
'{"A": "Agricultural antibiotic use contributes to resistance through multiple transmission routes to humans.", "B": "Resistance develops only when patients fail to complete prescribed antibiotic courses.", "C": "Banning all agricultural antibiotics would immediately solve resistance problems.", "D": "Human medical use is the sole cause of antibiotic resistance development."}',
'A',
'{"rationale": "The passage explicitly describes how agricultural antibiotic use creates resistance conditions and lists multiple pathways for resistant bacteria to transfer from farms to humans (direct contact, meat consumption, environmental spread). This directly supports the statement.", "why_others_wrong": {"B": "Passage focuses on agricultural overuse, not patient compliance", "C": "Passage presents different researcher proposals, not immediate solution claims", "D": "Passage extensively discusses agricultural contribution, not just human use"}}',

'The passage implies that early cinema audiences',
'When motion pictures first appeared in the 1890s, audiences reacted with astonishment. People allegedly jumped from their seats when a train appeared to rush toward the camera. Modern viewers find such reactions puzzling since we instantly recognize filmed images as representations, not reality. However, early audiences lacked our lifetime of experience interpreting moving images. They had never seen photographs that moved. Their perceptual systems, trained only by direct observation of the physical world, struggled to process this new medium. Within a few years, as cinema became common, audiences learned to interpret these images automatically, just as we do today.',
'{"A": "lacked intelligence compared to modern viewers", "B": "had not yet developed the learned skill of interpreting filmed images", "C": "preferred theater performances to motion pictures", "D": "intentionally exaggerated their reactions for entertainment"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage explains early audiences reactions by noting they lacked lifetime experience interpreting moving images and their perceptual systems were only trained by direct observation. This describes a learned skill they had not yet developed.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Passage explains difference as experience, not intelligence", "C": "Theater preferences are not mentioned", "D": "Passage treats reactions as genuine perceptual responses"}}',

'It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the author views standardized testing as',
'Standardized tests provide objective data that can reveal achievement gaps between student populations, potentially highlighting systemic inequities requiring intervention. When properly designed, these assessments measure critical skills and knowledge across large populations comparably. However, standardized tests also carry significant drawbacks. They narrow curriculum as schools focus on tested content, reducing time for arts, physical education, and project-based learning. Test performance correlates strongly with socioeconomic status, raising questions about whether tests measure student ability or family resources. Moreover, a single test score provides limited insight into complex capabilities like creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking that define real-world success.',
'{"A": "completely without value and should be immediately eliminated", "B": "perfect tools that accurately measure all important student abilities", "C": "useful for some purposes but accompanied by significant limitations", "D": "biased instruments that only measure family wealth"}',

'{"rationale": "The author presents both benefits (objective data, reveal gaps, measure skills) and drawbacks (narrow curriculum, correlate with wealth, limited insight). This balanced presentation matches useful for some purposes but with limitations.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Author acknowledges tests provide some value", "B": "Author extensively discusses tests limitations and what they miss", "D": "Correlation with wealth is one concern among several, not sole defining feature"}}',

'Which inference about ancient trade networks is most strongly supported by the passage?',
'Archaeological discoveries reveal that ancient trade networks were far more extensive than once believed. Roman coins have been found in Vietnam. Chinese silk appeared in Egyptian tombs dated to 1000 BCE. Obsidian from Mediterranean sources has been identified at sites thousands of miles away. These artifacts suggest not direct point-to-point journeys but complex chains of exchange where goods passed through multiple intermediaries. A merchant might trade grain for cloth, which another trader exchanged for spices, which yet another swapped for metals. Individual traders likely never knew the full extent of the networks they participated in, yet these interconnected exchanges linked distant civilizations through material culture long before any single merchant traveled the complete route.',
'{"A": "Ancient merchants regularly completed solo journeys spanning entire continents.", "B": "Trade goods moved through sequential exchanges rather than direct long-distance transport.", "C": "Most ancient civilizations remained completely isolated from one another.", "D": "Archaeological evidence of trade is limited to Mediterranean regions."}',

This directly supports sequential exchanges rather than direct transport.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Passage states individual merchants likely never traveled complete routes", "C": "Passage demonstrates civilizations were connected through trade", "D": "Passage provides examples from Vietnam, Egypt, China—beyond Mediterranean"}}',

'Based on the passage, the authors discussion of neuroplasticity most strongly implies that',
'For decades, neuroscientists believed adult brains were essentially fixed structures, unable to generate new neurons or substantially reorganize neural connections. This view has been revolutionized by discoveries of neuroplasticity—the brains capacity to change throughout life. Learning new skills creates new synaptic connections. Brain regions can reorganize after injury, with undamaged areas sometimes assuming functions of damaged ones. Even personality traits once considered immutable can shift as neural patterns evolve. However, neuroplasticity has limits. Brain changes require consistent effort over time, not overnight transformation. Age reduces but does not eliminate plasticity. Severe damage may exceed the brains compensatory abilities. These findings suggest human potential is greater than previously imagined, while remaining constrained by biological realities.',
'{"A": "any brain damage can be completely reversed through neuroplasticity", "B": "adult brains retain significant capacity for change while facing some limitations", "C": "personality is entirely determined by genetics and cannot change", "D": "neuroplasticity only occurs during childhood development"}',
'B',
'{"rationale": "The passage describes neuroplasticity as the brains capacity to change throughout life with examples of learning, reorganization, and personality shifts, but explicitly notes limitations (requires effort, age reduces plasticity, severe damage may exceed compensation). This matches significant capacity with limitations.", "why_others_wrong": {"A": "Passage states severe damage may exceed compensatory abilities", "C": "Passage explicitly states personality traits can shift", "D": "Passage focuses on adult brain changes, contradicting childhood-only claim"}}',
