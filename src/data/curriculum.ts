Poor quality could quickly destroy the business reputation and customer base. Craft beer consumers are typically quality-conscious and willing to pay higher prices for superior products. However, cost minimization enables competitive pricing and higher profit margins, allowing investment in marketing and expansion. Excessive costs could price the brewery out of the market.

The alliteration in "lean, long, dusty, dreary" emphasizes his unappealing physical appearance through harsh sounds. However, the contrasting phrase "And yet somehow lovable" acts as a turning point, using the conjunction "yet" to introduce contradiction. The metaphor "something eminently human beaconed from his eye" suggests warmth beneath the surface, with "beaconed" implying guidance and hope.

The word "tumult" suggests chaos and violence, while "wuthering" itself implies harsh weather conditions. The personification of thorns "craving alms of the sun" effectively suggests desperation and need, creating sympathy while emphasizing the harsh environment. The "excessive slant" of trees provides concrete evidence of the wind\'s power, making the description believable. The isolation is conveyed through the remote "station" and the focus on natural forces rather than human presence. However, some readers might argue the descriptive language becomes overly elaborate, potentially distancing readers from the immediate sense of place. Overall, the combination of specific detail and figurative language successfully establishes the Gothic atmosphere central to the novel.',
